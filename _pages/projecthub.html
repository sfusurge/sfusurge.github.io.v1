		<div class="about-body">
			Project Hub is is a student-run software engineering team devoted to building software projects in a collaborative and professional environment. Our primary objective is to be the best space at SFU for students to meet other tech enthusiasts, build projects in a team setting, gain experience with professional development tools and principles, and share their knowledge with others.
			We form teams based on common interests and project ideas of our own choosing, and hack on our projects to completion!
